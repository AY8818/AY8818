![I am Backend Developer]
### Hi there 👋, I'm a Backend Developer in Progress.

I design and build robust backedn systesm with a strong grasp of web fundamentals, API design, and relational data modeling. My work focuses on writing clean, maintainable code and solving real-world backend problems wiht a system-level mindset.

## Core Expertise
1. Backend Development: Java (primary), experience across multiple backend ecosystems

2. Web Architecture: HTTP, DNS, domain management, hosting, browser internals, and request lifecycles

3. Frontend Fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for seamless backend–frontend integration

4. Databases: Relational databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and MariaDB

5. Data Handling: Schema design, migrations, query optimization, and N+1 problem mitigation

6. API Engineering: RESTful APIs, JSON-based services, OpenAPI specifications, and API versioning

## What This Repository Represents
- Backend services built with clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented APIs following industry standards
- Database-driven applications with performance considerations
- Practical implementations reflecting real engineering trade-offs

I approach backend development with a systems-first mindset—understanding how components interact, identifying bottlenecks early, and building solutions that scale cleanly. Emphasis is placed on correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability.
